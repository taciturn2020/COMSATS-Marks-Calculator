HOW TO USE:


Select the type of course (LAB or THEORY)

Select the number of credit hours ( This can have an effect on how marks are calculated for lab courses)

Total Marks refers to marks over all assignments/quizzes, so four assignments of 10 marks would have a total of 40 marks and if you obtained 9 marks in each assignment then your total obtained marks would equal to 36


GRADING INFO:


KEEP a margin on the marks depending on how well you did in your lab final exam / project.


Subtract marks lost from 100 to get your grade for the subject
